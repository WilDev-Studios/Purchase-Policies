# Purchase Policies
List of all of our purchasing policies on [ImperialPlugins.com](https://imperialplugins.com)

## Non-Exclusive Sales
### 3-Day Money-back Guarantee
We understand that sometimes plugins just do not work or they do not fit your expectations, so we understand the frustrations behind not getting your money back for something you don't want right after purchase. We have implemented a 3-day money-back guarantee** to make sure you get your money back in the event you don't want your plugin anymore.

#### How do I get my refund?
Make sure you are within the 3 days mentioned above**<br>
Ping (@) 'Refund Notifications' in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/4Ggybyy87d) in the #ðŸ¥ºã€¢requests channel<br>
*Follow this template:*<br><br>
**[ @Refund Notifications ]**<br>
**Plugin:** (Plugin Name)<br><br>
> NOTE: If your Discord friends settings prohibit non-friend messages, then a refund will not be possible until it is allowed so the developers can contact you

Expect a message on Discord within a few minutes to hours. We want to get back with you, just please be patient.<br>
We expect our customers to be honest in their refunds. If we see that you lied about anything, we can refuse it entirely.<br>
> NOTICE: Refunds are not policy on ImperialPlugins.com, so this is out of kindness from WilDev Studios, so we can refuse refunds at any time

**Exception: If a user wants a refund on a plugin further than 3 days past the purchase date, they may file a form on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/4Ggybyy87d). However, we cannot guarantee that a refund will be possible

### Licenses
Each plugin purchase comes with a license key specific to you and your order.<br>
This license key is only to be used and endorsed by you and/or your server manager(s) for the use of the server(s) that the plugin was purchased for.<br>

## Exclusive Sales
If you ask for a plugin to be made just for you and not to be sold for retail on [ImperialPlugins.com](https://imperialplugins.com) then the licensing and purchasing policies are different.

### Refunds are not possible
If the plugin has to be made completely from scratch, then that is work that WilDev Studios has to do in order to make that plugin. If the plugin was made for one person **exclusively** and they want a refund, then there really was no point in wasting our employees time (and company resources).

> NOTE: If a refund is requested because of a bug, ask WilDev Studios to fix it (free of charge).

### Licensing
When having requested and purchased an exclusive plugin from WilDev Studios, you inherit all rights, responsibilities, and process of the plugin in question. Rights to reproduce, duplicate, delete, etc. are all granted to you. WilDev Studios will no longer have any rights to the plugin. If you wish to have it updated then it will be treated as a typical plugin update request so a charge will be applied for an update.

> NOTICE:
> - If a plugin needs to be updated because of a bug that was present at the time of sale, there will be no charge applied as this is a base plugin problem (and won't function if not updated).
> - However, if the plugin needs updated for a new, removed, or edited feature then a charge will be applied.
> - Any library that needs to be updated will have a charge applied. This is relatively simple to do so there should be no issues with library updates.
