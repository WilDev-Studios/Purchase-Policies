# Purchase Policies
List of all of our purchasing policies on [ImperialPlugins.com](https://imperialplugins.com)

## 3-Day Money-back Guarantee
We understand that sometimes plugins just do not work or they do not fit your expectations, so we understand the frustrations behind not getting your money back for something you don't want right after purchase. We have implemented a 3-day money-back guarantee to make sure you get your money back in the event you don't want your plugin anymore.

### How do I get my refund?
Make sure you are within the 3 days mentioned above<br>

We expect our customers to be honest in their refunds. If we see that you lied about anything, we can refuse it entirely.<br>
> NOTICE: Refunds are not policy on ImperialPlugins.com, so this is out of kindness from WilDev Studios, so they can refuse refunds at any time

## Licenses
Each plugin purchase comes with a license key specific to you and your order.<br>
This license key is only to be used and endorsed by you and/or your server manager(s) for the use of the server that the plugin was purchased for<br>
